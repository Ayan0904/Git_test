    <!-- links goes with a tag but they have to be provided with html attributes -->
    <!-- An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the elementâ€™s opening tag. 
    An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value.  -->

    <!-- Absolute Links
Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links.
 A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path -->
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>


    <!-- Relative Links -->
<!-- Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links.
     Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site,
      it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. -->
